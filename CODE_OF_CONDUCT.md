# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment — especially as part of our Winter of Code Social open‑source mentorship initiative — we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project’s goals

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing other people’s private information (e.g., physical or electronic address) without explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional‑setting or open‑source mentorship context

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers (and Winter of Code mentors/co‑mentors) are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project maintainers at via their GitHub profile:**[@salonijoshi1980](https://github.com/salonijoshi1980)**. All reports will be handled with discretion and with respect for the privacy of all parties involved.

When submitting a report, include as many details as you can:  
- What happened  
- When it happened  
- Where (e.g., issue URL, PR link, discussion thread)  
- Who was involved  
- Any supporting evidence (links, screenshot(s), message copies)  
This assists in a faster, fairer investigation and resolution.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (e.g., repository issues, pull requests, chat rooms) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or our Winter of Code community. Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social‑media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. It also applies to private communications when those communications have the potential to impact the project or community.

## Enforcement Process

1. Reports will be reviewed and investigated in a timely and confidential manner by the maintainers or designated people (including Winter of Code mentors).  
2. Valid complaints may result in temporary or permanent removal of access to project resources and/or removal from the community, depending on the severity and frequency of the behaviour.  
3. The maintainers will strive to follow a **restorative approach** when possible (encouraging learning and repair of harm) while also taking necessary steps to protect the community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1 (see <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/>).  
This is a living document — we may revise it as needed. When changes are made, we will make reasonable efforts to communicate them to the community.
